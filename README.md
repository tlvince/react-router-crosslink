> React Router Link with parametrised history

The same as React Router DOM `<Link>` except it supports optionally reading `history` as a prop.

```js
import CrossLink from 'react-router-crosslink'
import createHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory'

// In practice, you'll probably be creating this elsewhere
const history = createHistory()

<CrossLink
  to='/'
  history={history}
/>
```

## Intended use case

Multiple "sub-apps", which are integrated together via a parent app. Sub apps should be able to run standalone and set up their own routing. The parent app "mounts" each sub-app under a child route (via [basename][]). Given basenames are prefixed to all URLs, the sub-app can't "break out" of its child route using traditional `<Link>`.

By passing the parent app's `history` to `<CrossLink>`, sub-apps can cross-link between themselves. See this [CodeSandbox][].
